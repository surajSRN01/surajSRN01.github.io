            <h3 class="section-title">What is OOP's?</h3>
            <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of "objects," which can contain data and methods to manipulate that data. 
                OOP is based on several key principles that help to model real-world entities and their interactions in a more intuitive and maintainable way.
            </p>

            <h3 class="section-title">Building blocks of OOPs</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Classes:</strong> <p>A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that the objects created from it will have.</p></li> 
                    <li><strong>Objects :</strong> <p>An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with attributes (data) and behaviors (methods).
                        <br>For example, a Car object might have attributes like color, model, and speed, and behaviors like drive() and brake().</p></li>
                    <li><strong>Methods :</strong> <p>Methods are functions defined within a class that describe the behaviors of the objects created from the class. 
                        <br>They can modify the object’s state or perform actions with the object. 
                        <br>They can accept parameters, return values, and are used to perform an action on an object of a class.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Attributes :</strong><p>Attributes, also known as properties or fields, are variables that store data related to a class and its objects. </p></li>
                </ul>
            <br>
            <h3 class="section-title">Principles of OOPs</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> 
                        <p>Encapsulation in OOP refers to binding data and the methods to manipulate that data together in a single unit—class.
                           <br>Encapsulation is usually done to hide the state and representation of an object from the outside.

                        <p>In the above example, the model and year fields are encapsulated within the Car class. They are private, meaning they cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. Access to these fields is controlled through public getter and setter methods.</p>

                    <li><strong>Abstraction :</strong> 
                        <p>Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the essential features or functionalities.
                        <br>The main goal of abstraction is to reduce complexity by allowing the user to focus on "what" an object does rather than "how" it does it.</p>

                    <li><strong>Inheritance :</strong> 
                        <p>It is the mechanism in Java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class. 
                            <br>In Java, Inheritance means creating new classes based on existing ones. A class that inherits from another class can reuse the methods and fields of that class. 
                            <br>In addition, you can add new fields and methods to your current class as well. 
                            <br>In Java, inheritance is implemented using the extends keyword. A subclass inherits all non-private fields and methods from its superclass.
                        </p>
                        “when do we use inheritance?” Wherever we come across an IS-A relationship between objects, we can use inheritance.
                                <img src="images/is-a.PNG" alt="dns-hierarchy" style="display: block; margin: auto;">
                                Remember, we cannot use inheritance if an IS-A relationship doesn’t exist between classes.<br><br>
                        <b>Types of inheritance:</b>
                        <ol>
                                <li><strong>Single inheritance: </strong>A class inherits from one superclass.<br>
                                    Example: A fuel car IS-A vehicle
                                    <img src="images/single-inheritance.PNG" alt="dns-hierarchy" style="display: block; margin: auto;">
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Multilevel Inheritance: </strong>A class is derived from a class that is also derived from another class.<br>
                                    Example:<br>
                                    A fuel car IS-A vehicle<br>
                                    A gasoline car IS-A fuel car

                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Hierarchical Inheritance: </strong>Multiple classes inherit from a single superclass.<br>
                                    Example:<br>
                                    A fuel car IS-A vehicle<br>                                
                                    An electric car IS-A vehicle<br>

                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Multiple Inheritance: </strong>When a class is derived from more than one base class, i.e., when a class has more than one immediate parent class, it is called multiple inheritance.<br>
                                    Exmple: <br>
                                    The hybrid car IS-A fuel car.<br>
                                    The hybrid car IS-A electric car as well.
                                    <img src="images/multiple-inheritance.PNG" alt="dns-hierarchy" style="display: block; margin: auto;">
                                    Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes to avoid ambiguity (the diamond problem), but it does allow a class to implement multiple interfaces.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Hybrid Inheritance: </strong>A type of inheritance that is a combination of more than one type of inheritance is called hybrid inheritance.<br>
                                    Exmple: <br>
                                    A fuel car IS-A vehicle.<br>
                                    An electric car IS-A vehicle.<br>
                                    A hybrid car IS-A fuel car and IS-A electric car.

                                </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><b>Note:</b><br>
                            - If a subclass defines a field with the same name as a field in its superclass, the field in the subclass shadows the field in the superclass. <br>The superclass field can still be accessed using <b>super.fieldName</b>.<br>
                            - Constructors are not inherited. However, a subclass constructor can call a superclass constructor using super().<br>
                            - When an object is created, the constructors of the superclass are called before the subclass constructors, creating a "chain" of constructor calls.<br>
                            - final class: A class declared as final cannot be extended.<br>
                            - final method: A method declared as final cannot be overridden by subclasses.<br>
