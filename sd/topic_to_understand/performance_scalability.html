            <h3 class="section-title">What is Performance?</h3>
                <p>Performance refers to how efficiently a system or application accomplishes its tasks under a specific workload. 
                    It is typically measured in terms of latency, throughput , and resource utilization.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Latency:</strong> The time it takes for a system to respond to a request.</li>
                    <li><strong>Throughput:</strong> The number of tasks or operations a system can handle in a given time frame.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resource Utilization:</strong> How much of the system's resources (like CPU, memory, etc.) are being used.</li>
                </ul>
                Generally, you should aim for maximal throughput with acceptable latency.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Example:</h5>
                <p>Consider a popular e-commerce website like Amazon during normal shopping hours. The website must quickly respond to user actions like searching for products, adding items to the cart, and checking out. 
                    If the page loads instantly and the system can handle thousands of users searching and viewing products simultaneously without slowing down, the system is said to have high performance.</p>
                <h5>challenges:</h5>
                <p>Performance can degrade if the system faces unexpected traffic spikes, inefficient algorithms, or insufficient hardware resources, leading to slow response times and reduced throughput.</p>
            <br>

            <h3 class="section-title">What is Scalability?</h3>
                <p>Scalability refers to a system's ability to handle a growing amount of work or its potential to accommodate growth. 
                    It’s about how well the system can maintain or improve its performance as the demand increases by adding more resources, such as servers, storage, or databases.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Vertical Scalability (Scaling Up):</strong> Adding more power to the existing machine (e.g., adding more CPU, memory).</li>
                    <li><strong>Horizontal Scalability (Scaling Out):</strong> Adding more machines or nodes to distribute the load (e.g., adding more servers to a cluster).</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Example:</h5>
                <p>Imagine it’s Black Friday, and traffic spikes to 10 times the normal load. 
                    If the website can still handle the increased number of users without slowing down or crashing by adding more servers, then it’s considered to be scalable.</p>
                <h5>challenges:</h5>
                <p>Scaling can be complex and expensive. Vertical scaling is often limited by hardware constraints, while horizontal scaling requires systems to manage distributed processes, data consistency, and more sophisticated load balancing.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title">Interview Questions and Answers</h2>
                <div class="interview-question">
                    <strong>Q1: You have a system that performs well under low load but struggles as the user base grows. 
                        Would you consider this a performance issue or a scalability issue? How would you address it?</strong>
                </div>
                <div class="interview-answer">
                    <p>The question is designed to test your understanding of the interplay between performance and scalability. It's both a performance and scalability issue. 
                        The system performs well under low load (indicating good performance in that context), but as the load increases, it struggles, highlighting a scalability problem. 
                        Addressing it may involve both performance optimizations and scalable architecture adjustments, such as load balancing or distributed computing.
                        </p>
                </div>

                <div class="interview-question">
                    <strong>Q2: If a database query is running slowly, is it a performance issue or a scalability issue? 
                    How would your approach differ if you needed to solve this for a single user versus thousands of concurrent users?</strong>
                </div>
                <div class="interview-answer">
                    <p>For a single user, it's a performance issue, and you might optimize the query or indexing. 
                        For thousands of users, it becomes a scalability issue, and you'd consider approaches like query optimization combined with database sharding, caching, or read replicas to handle the load.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="interview-question">
                    <strong>Q3: A web application is fast when serving one user but slows down significantly when serving 100 users simultaneously. 
                        Is the problem more likely related to performance or scalability? How would you diagnose and solve this issue?</strong>
                </div>
                <div class="interview-answer">
                    <p>The issue is more related to scalability, as the system cannot handle increased load efficiently. 
                        However, diagnosing might reveal specific performance bottlenecks (like inefficient code, poor database queries) that are exacerbated by the higher load. 
                        The solution would involve both optimizing the existing performance and ensuring that the system architecture scales, such as adding more servers or using a CDN.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="interview-question">
                    <strong>Q4: Can a system be scalable but not performant? Give an example and explain how you would improve it.</strong>
                </div>
                <div class="interview-answer">
                    <p>Yes, a system can scale by adding more resources, but each resource might not be efficiently utilized, leading to poor performance. 
                        For example, a poorly optimized query might still run slowly even if the database is scaled out horizontally. 
                        Improving this involves optimizing the query to improve performance, which complements scalability.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="interview-question">
                    <strong>Q5: You have two web services: Service A has low latency but cannot handle more than 100 requests per second, while Service B can handle 10,000 requests per second but has higher latency. 
                        How would you improve both performance and scalability for these services?</strong>
                </div>
                <div class="interview-answer">
                    <p>This question tests your ability to balance performance and scalability. For Service A, you might scale it horizontally or optimize its code to handle more requests while maintaining low latency. 
                        For Service B, you could work on reducing latency through optimizations like reducing response size or improving network paths, while maintaining its high scalability.</p>
