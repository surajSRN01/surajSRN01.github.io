                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An application-layer protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML.</li>
                            <li>HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web.</li>
                            <li>It is a stateless protocol, meaning each request from a client to server is independent, and the server does not retain user state between requests.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An extension of HTTP, where communication between the client and server is encrypted using TLS (Transport Layer Security) or SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).</li>
                            <li>HTTPS ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data exchanged between the client and server.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

            <h3 class="section-title">How HTTP/HTTPS Works?</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HTTP:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The client (usually a web browser) sends an HTTP request to the server, typically requesting a resource like a web page.</li>
                            <li>The server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response, which usually contains the requested resource (e.g., an HTML file, image, etc.).</li>
                            <li>HTTP operates over TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), usually on port 80.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>HTTPS:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>HTTPS follows the same process as HTTP, but before data is sent, the client and server establish a secure connection using SSL/TLS.</li>
                            <li>This secure connection ensures that the data exchanged is encrypted, preventing eavesdropping and tampering.</li>
                            <li>HTTPS typically operates over port 443.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h3 class="section-title">Why HTTP/HTTPS is Used?</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HTTP:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To request and receive web resources such as HTML pages, images, and other multimedia content.</li>
                            <li>Facilitates communication between web browsers and servers on the internet.</li>
                            <li>Supports various methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., to interact with resources on the server.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>HTTPS:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To secure data transmission between clients and servers, protecting sensitive information (e.g., login credentials, payment details).</li>
                            <li>Ensures that the data exchanged is not intercepted, tampered with, or forged by attackers.</li>
                            <li>Provides authentication to confirm the identity of the communicating parties.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>SSL is a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server and a clientâ€”typically 
                                a web server (website) and a browser or a mail server and a mail client (e.g., Outlook).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>TLS (Transport Layer Security):</strong>

                            <li>TLS is the successor to SSL and is more secure and efficient.</li>
                            <li>It is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure communication over a computer network.</li>

            <h3 class="section-title">SSL/TLS Handshake Process (In-Depth)</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Step 1: Client Hello</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The client initiates the handshake by sending a "Client Hello" message, which includes the SSL/TLS version it supports, 
                                the list of encryption algorithms, and a randomly generated number.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Step 2: Server Hello</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The server responds with a "Server Hello" message, selecting the encryption algorithm from the list provided by the client 
                                and sending its SSL/TLS certificate. This certificate contains the server's public key.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Step 3: Server Certificate and Key Exchange</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The server sends its SSL/TLS certificate, and if required, a "Server Key Exchange" message. 
                                The client verifies the certificate to ensure the server's authenticity.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Step 4: Client Key Exchange</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The client generates a "pre-master secret," encrypts it with the server's public key, and sends it to the server. 
                                Both client and server use this pre-master secret to generate the session keys used to encrypt the data.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Step 5: Finished Messages</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Both the client and server send a "Finished" message, encrypted with the session key, indicating that 
                                the handshake is complete and a secure session is established.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Step 6: Secure Communication</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>All subsequent communication between the client and server is encrypted using the session keys established during the handshake.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
